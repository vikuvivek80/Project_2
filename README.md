# Tiny URL Project

The **Tiny URL** project focuses on creating a URL shortening service, similar to services like Bit.ly or TinyURL. This project provides an efficient way to transform long URLs into shorter, more manageable links, making them easier to share. It's an excellent project for learning about web services, databases, and the fundamentals of hashing and encoding techniques.

## Project Overview

### Objective

The primary goal of this project is to implement a URL shortening service that converts long URLs into short, unique identifiers. Users can generate short links, retrieve the original URLs from those short links, and manage their links through a simple interface.

### Features

- **URL Shortening:** Convert a long URL into a shorter version with a unique identifier.
- **URL Redirection:** Redirect users from the shortened URL to the original long URL.
- **User Interaction:** Simple command-line or web-based interface for creating and managing shortened URLs.
- **Data Persistence:** Store the mappings between long URLs and their shortened versions using a database or file system.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need Python installed on your system. Additional libraries such as Flask or Django may be required if implementing a web interface.

### Running the Program

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vikuvivek80/tiny-url.git
    cd tiny-url
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    If the project uses a web framework or other libraries, install them with:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Program:**

    Execute the program with the following command:

    ```bash
    python tiny_url.py
    ```

4. **Use the Program:**

    - Input a long URL to generate a shortened version.
    - Use the generated short URL to be redirected to the original long URL.

### Example

- **Original URL:** `https://www.example.com/some/very/long/url`
- **Shortened URL:** `https://tiny.url/abc123`

## Insights and Considerations

The Tiny URL project introduces several key concepts that are fundamental to web development and software engineering:

- **Hashing and Encoding:** Learn how to generate unique identifiers for URLs.
- **Database Management:** Understand how to store and retrieve URL mappings efficiently.
- **Web Development:** Explore how to create a simple web interface for user interaction.
- **Security:** Consider the importance of securing URLs and preventing abuse.

## Future Enhancements

While the basic Tiny URL implementation is functional, there are several ways to extend the project:

- **Custom Short URLs:** Allow users to specify custom short links instead of randomly generated ones.
- **Analytics:** Track the number of clicks and other statistics for each shortened URL.
- **Expiration Dates:** Implement expiration dates for short URLs, automatically deleting them after a certain period.
- **API Integration:** Develop an API that allows other applications to use the URL shortening service programmatically.
